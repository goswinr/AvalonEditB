[AvalonEditB](https://github.com/goswinr/AvalonEditB) is a fork of a [AvalonEdit](https://github.com/icsharpcode/AvalonEdit)
with some small modifications like:
* Search and replace functionality from a [PR](https://github.com/icsharpcode/AvalonEdit/pull/99)
* Some private properties exposed as public
* Block selection with middle mouse button (like VS code)

### Documentation
Check out the original [original documentation](http://avalonedit.net/documentation/) and the [samples and articles wiki page](https://github.com/icsharpcode/AvalonEdit/wiki/Samples-and-Articles). 
Building the documentation and running the test currently does not work from this fork.
